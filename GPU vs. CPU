GPU calculation
For GTX 1060, the computation power is 3855 (boost 4372) (GFLOPS) (128 bit bus width)
For an i-7 Haswell E (Core i7 5960X and 5930K) gflops is 384 (64 bit bus width)
The memory of GPU is GDDR 5, while that for CPU is DDR4/3.
Therefore, the speed for me to train a CNN on gpu is about 200~ 300 times of that of CPU.
